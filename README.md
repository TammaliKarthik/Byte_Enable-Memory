## Extended Project Abstract (up to 300 words)

This project focuses on the design and implementation of Byte-Enable Memory on FPGA to address the increasing need for efficient and flexible memory architectures in modern digital systems. Byte-Enable Memory allows for selective read/write operations at the byte level, enabling fine-grained data manipulation in applications like image processing and machine learning. This granularity enhances memory utilization by reducing write overhead and enabling precise control over data access. Verilog is used for architectural modelling, while SystemVerilog facilitates the development of advanced test benches for comprehensive validation. Xilinx Vivado is employed for synthesis, simulation, and real-time testing, with a strong emphasis on optimizing resource utilization, maximizing performance, and minimizing power consumption.

The design incorporates byte-enable signals for each memory location, enabling precise control over which bytes are accessed during read and write operations. The project aims to deliver a high-performance and flexible Byte-Enable Memory solution tailored for demanding applications that require precise control over data manipulation at the byte level.
